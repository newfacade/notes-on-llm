    "we run SWE-agent on the latest commit for at most 100 steps, instructing\n",
    "it to install the codebase and run the test suite. We then manually verify the installation\n",
    "and testing instructions, check if more than 80% of existing tests pass, and finally create\n",
    "a Docker image for the repository.\n",

    "**Creating task instance candidates.** we employ four different strategies to\n",
    "create candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LM Generation:** Per repository, we identify all programmatic entities (functions, classes),\n",
    "then take two approaches: (1) provide anLM with the function and prompt it to introduce\n",
    "errant modifications (henceforth referred to as “LM Modify”), and (2) given only the\n",
    "function header and docstring, ask the LM to rewrite it (“LM Rewrite”).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Procedural Modification:** Per function, we acquire an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation\n",
    "of the code, then randomly perform one or more transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Combine Bugs:** To create more complex tasks that require editing multiple\n",
    "portions of the codebase, we devise a “Patch Combination” strategy that creates a task\n",
    "instance by aggregating candidates from the same file(s) or module(s).\n",
