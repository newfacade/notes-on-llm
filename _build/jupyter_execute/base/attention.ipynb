    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ to a sequence\n",
    "of continuous representations $(z_1,\\dots,z_n)$. Given $\\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output\n",
    "sequence $(y_1,\\dots,y_m)$ of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
    "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    "respectively.\n",

    "### Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoder:** The encoder is composed of a stack of $N = 6$ identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
    "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise\n",
    "fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each of\n",
    "the two sub-layers, followed by [](layer_normalization). That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{LayerNorm}(x+\\text{Sublayer}(x)).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
    "layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{\\text{model}}=512$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder:** The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N = 6$ identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
    "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
    "attention over the output of the encoder stack. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "* The output of the encoder stack means the output of the `last` encoder layer!\n",
    "* Encoder and decoder layer has the same `num_steps`, using mask to incorporate with different sentence length.\n",
    "* In “encoder-decoder attention” layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of `key-value pairs` to an output, the output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
    "query with the corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
    "queries and keys of dimension $d_k$, and values of dimension $d_v$. We compute the dot products of the\n",
    "query with all keys, divide each by $\\sqrt{d_k}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
    "into a matrix $Q$. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$. We compute\n",
    "the matrix of outputs as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\right)V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We suspect that for large values of $d_k$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "We found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times with different, learned\n",
    "linear projections to $d_k$, $d_k$ and $d_v$ dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",
    "queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_v$-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\n",
    "subspaces at different positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) &= \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1,\\dots,\\text{head}_h)W^{O}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{where head}_{i} &= \\text{Attention}(QW_{i}^{Q}, KW_{i}^{K}, VW_{i}^{V})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the projections are parameter matrices $W_{i}^{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{model}}\\times d_k}$, $W_{i}^{K}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{model}}\\times d_k}$, $W_{i}^{V}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{model}}\\times d_v}$ and $W_{O}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\times d_{\\text{model}}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position `separately and identically`. This\n",
    "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FFN}(x) = \\max(0, xW_1+b_1)W_2 + b_2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension $d_\\text{model}$. We also use the usual learned linear transformation\n",
    "and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    "our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
    "linear transformation. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by $\\sqrt{d_{\\text{model}}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "This scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_{\\text{model}}}$ is applied to ensure that the magnitude of the embeddings is appropriately balanced with the positional encodings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    "order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    "tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    "bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "PE_{(pos,2i)} &= sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}})\\\\\n",
    "PE_{(pos,2i+1)} &= cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    "corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2\\pi$ to $10000\\cdot 2\\pi$. We\n",
    "chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    "relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    "$PE_{pos}$.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings instead, and found that the two\n",
    "versions produced nearly identical results. We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    "because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    "during training."
