    "To find high-quality task instances at scale,\n",
    "we use a 3-stage pipeline as follows.\n",

    "1. **Repo selection and data scraping.** We start by collecting pull requests (PRs) from 12\n",
    "popular open-source Python repositories on GitHub, producing about ∼ 90,000 PRs in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attribute-based filtering.** We create candidate tasks by selecting the `merged` PRs that (1)\n",
    "resolve a GitHub issue and (2) make changes to the test files of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution-based filtering.** We filter out task\n",
    "instances without at least one test where its status changes from a fail to pass.\n",

    "that have been sampled to be more self-contained, with a focus on evaluating functional bug fixes."

    "\n",
    "Once the retrieved files are selected using one of the two methods above, we construct the input\n",
