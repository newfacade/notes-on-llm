    "We introduce Open-Coder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance comparable to\n",
    "leading models but also serves as an “open cookbook” for the research community.\n",
    "Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference\n",
    "code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline,\n",
    "rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open\n",
    "scientific research.<br/>\n",
    "Our key design choices for data curation:\n",
    "1. During the pretraining phase, the importance of data cleaning is highlighted.\n",
    "2. The impact of deduplication is significant, with file-level deduplication proving to be more effective than repository-level deduplication.\n",
    "3. Filtering data based on Github star count can possibly reduce data diversity\n",
    "and affect the overall data distribution, contributing to a suboptimal result.\n",
    "4. In the annealing phase, the use of high-quality data is crucial for further enhancing the model’s\n",
    "capabilities.\n",
    "5. During the instruction tuning phase, a two-stage instruction tuning strategy\n",
    "is shown to be effective.\n",

    "for Python code, we enhance the effectiveness of Magicoder{cite}`wei2024magicoderempoweringcodegeneration`. Specifically, we observe that the educational value of the synthesized data `largely depends on the quality of the seed data`. Our approach:\n",
    "1. Using only high-quality seed data.\n",
    "2. Use a teacher model to generate multiple test cases for the code sections in each problem. These test cases\n",
    "are appended to the code snippets and executed using a Python interpreter. Only the data samples\n",

    "1. Analyzed commonly used external Python libraries and retrieved API signatures and usage examples via PyDoc.\n",

    "**Large-scale Diverse Instruction Synthesis** To\n",
    "increase the diversity of the instruction dataset:\n",
    "1. An LLM is used first to clean the irrelevant context in the websites and select useful sentences as the seed for further question generation.\n",
    "2. A task specification module defines programming languages, difficulty levels, and coding task\n",
    "types. The prompt engineering component employs a template-based system to generate diverse, contextually rich prompts, incorporating realworld\n",
    "scenarios and best practices in software development. We set temperature $T = 1.0$ for diverse\n",
