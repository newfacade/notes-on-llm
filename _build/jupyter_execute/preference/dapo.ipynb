    "\n",
    "The KL penalty term is used to regulate the divergence between the online policy and the frozen reference\n",
    "policy. In the RLHF scenario, the goal of RL is to align the model behavior without diverging too far\n",
    "from the initial model. However, during training the long-CoT reasoning model, the model distribution can\n",

    "In this section, we will introduce the key techniques associated\n",
    "with DAPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clip-Higher\n",
    "\n",
    "In our initial experiments using naive PPO or GRPO, we observed the entropy collapse phenomenon:\n",
    "the entropy of the policy decreases quickly as training progresses. The sampled responses of\n",
    "certain groups tend to be nearly identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identify that the `upper clip can restrict the exploration of the policy`. In this case, it\n",
    "is much easier to make an ‘exploitation token’ more probable, than to uplift the probability of an unlikely\n",
    "‘exploration token’. Concretely, when $\\epsilon=0.2$, consider two actions with probabilities $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)=0.01$ and $0.9$. The maximum possible updated probabilities $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)=0.012$ and $1.08$, respectively. This implies that for tokens with a higher probability (e.g., $0.9$) is less constrained. Conversely,\n",
    "for low-probability tokens, achieving a non-trivial increase in probability is considerably more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhering to the Clip-Higher strategy, we decouple the lower and higher clipping range as $\\epsilon_{\\text{low}}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{high}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/dapo1.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose to over-sample and filter out prompts with the accuracy equal to 1 and 0, leaving all prompts in the batch with effective gradients and keeping a consistent number\n",
    "of prompts. Besides, we find that with dynamic sampling the experiment achieves the same performance\n",
    "faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original GRPO algorithm, all samples are assigned the same weight in the loss calculation, tokens within longer responses (which\n",
    "contain more tokens) may have a disproportionately lower contribution to the overall loss, which can lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For high-quality long samples, this effect can impede the model’s ability to learn\n",
    "reasoning-relevant patterns within them.\n",
    "2. We observe that excessively long samples often exhibit\n",
    "low-quality patterns such as gibberish and repetitive words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, sample-level loss calculation, due to its\n",
    "inability to effectively penalize those undesirable patterns in long samples, leads to an unhealthy increase in\n",
    "entropy and response length.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a `Token-level Policy Gradient Loss` in the long-CoT RL scenario to address the above limitations. In this setting, longer sequences can have more influence on the overall gradient update compared to shorter\n",
    "sequences. Moreover, from the perspective of individual tokens, if a particular generation pattern can lead to\n",
    "an increase or decrease in reward, it will be equally prompted or suppressed, regardless of the length of the\n",
    "response in which it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlong Reward Shaping\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL training, we typically set a maximum length for generation, with overlong samples truncated accordingly. By default, we assign a punitive reward to truncated samples. This approach may introduce noise into the\n",
    "training process, as a sound reasoning process can be penalized solely due to its excessive length. Such\n",
    "penalties can potentially confuse the model regarding the validity of its reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the impact of this reward noise, we first apply an Overlong Filtering strategy which `masks\n",
    "the loss of truncated samples`. We find that this approach significantly stabilizes training and enhances\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/dapo2.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we propose `Soft Overlong Punishment`, this penalty is added to the original rule-based correctness reward, thereby signaling\n",
    "to the model to avoid excessively long responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{\\text{length}}(y) = \n",

    "\n",
    "We use naive GRPO as our\n",

    "For hyper-parameters, we utilize the AdamW ptimizer with a constant learning rate of $1 × 10^{−6}$,\n",
    "incorporating a linear warm-up over 20 rollout steps. For rollout, the prompt batch size is 512 and we sample\n",
    "16 responses for each prompt. For training, the mini-batch size is set to 512, i.e., 16 gradient updates for\n",
    "each rollout step. For Overlong Reward Shaping, we set the expected maximum length as 16,384 tokens\n",
    "and allocate additional 4,096 tokens as the soft punish cache. As for the Clip-Higher mechanism, we set the clipping parameter $\\epsilon_{\\text{low}}$\n",
    "to 0.2 and $\\epsilon_{\\text{high}}$ to 0.28, which effectively balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. For\n",
    "evaluation on AIME, we repeat the evaluation set for 32 times and report avg@32 for results stability. The\n",
