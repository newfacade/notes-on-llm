    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct experiments in two separate regimes: large-scale and smallscale. At each model scale, we use a single fixed model to generate all solutions. We\n",
    "call this model the `generator`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do not attempt to improve the generator with\n",
    "reinforcement learning (RL). When we discuss outcome and process supervision,\n",
    "we are specifically referring to the supervision given to the reward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We focus exclusively on how to train the most reliable reward model\n",
    "possible. We evaluate a reward model by its ability to perform best-of-N search\n",
    "over uniformly sampled solutions from the generator.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Models\n",
    "\n",
    "All large-scale models are finetuned from the base GPT-4 model. The small-scale base models are similar in design to\n",
    "GPT-4, but they were pretrained with roughly 200 times less compute. As an\n",
    "additional pretraining step, we finetune all models on a dataset of roughly 1.5B math-relevant tokens, which we call MathMix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "We few-shot\n",
    "generate solutions to MATH training problems, filter to those that reach the\n",
    "correct final answer, and finetune the base model on this dataset for a single\n",
    "epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect process supervision data, we present human data-labelers with stepby-\n",
    "step solutions to MATH problems sampled by the large-scale generator.\n",
    "Their task is to assign each step in the solution a label of positive, negative,\n",
    "or neutral. We refer to the entire\n",
    "dataset of step-level labels collected as PRM800K. The PRM800K training\n",
    "set contains 800K step-level labels across 75K solutions to 12K problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/verify-step1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "During data collection, we must decide which solutions to surface to datalabelers. We would prefer to surface\n",
    "solutions that are more likely to fool our best reward model. To that end, we choose to surface `convincing wrong-answer` solutions. We use the term convincing\n",
    "to refer to solutions that are rated highly by our current best PRM, and\n",
    "we use wrong-answer to refer to solutions that reach an incorrect final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome-supervised Reward Models (ORMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "We\n",
    "uniformly sample a fixed number of solutions per problem from the generator,\n",
    "and we train the ORM to predict whether each solution is correct or incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process-supervised Reward Models (PRMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "We train PRMs to predict the correctness of each step after the last token in\n",
    "each step. This prediction takes the form of a single token, and we maximize the log-likelihood of these target tokens during training. The PRM can therefore\n",
    "be trained in a standard language model pipeline without any special accommodations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We train our PRMs by fine-tuning the MathMix model to predict the probability\n",
    "of positive, negative, and neutral labels given a solution prefix ending in one of\n",
    "our labeled steps.<br/>\n",

    "reward model, $\\text{PRM}_\\text{selector}$, on a single sample from each problem, and we use\n",
    "this model to score 1000 samples per problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train each of our larger reward\n",
    "models, we select N samples per problem such that 80% are the most\n",
    "convincing (according to $\\text{PRM}_\\text{selector}$) wrong-answer samples, and 20% are the\n",
    "most convincing samples that remain (right- or wrong-answer)."
