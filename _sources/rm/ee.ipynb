    "A common practice in RLHF is to send queries,\n",
    "each comprised of a prompt and a pair of distinct responses, to human raters. Each rater expresses a\n",
    "preference for one response over the other. Prompts are drawn from a corpus, while responses are\n",
    "generated by the large language model. As this process progresses, a reward model is fit to the data\n",
    "and steers subsequent responses to align with with feedback received thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the standard practice of sampling each pair of responses using the language model as passive exploration. We compare the performance of passive exploration to several active exploration algorithms. One is Boltzmann exploration, which\n",
