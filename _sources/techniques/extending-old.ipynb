    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) typically come with a pre-defined context window size. For example,\n",
    "inputs to LLaMA models must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\n",
    "context window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\n",
    "summarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\n",
    "longer context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\n",
    "windows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\n",
    "context window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to fine-tune an existing pre-trained Transformer with a longer context\n",
    "window. However, empirically, we found that models trained this way adapt to long context\n",
    "windows very slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "While certain techniques such as ALiBi and LeX enable length\n",
    "extrapolation of Transformers, i.e. train on short context windows and inference on longer ones,\n",
    "many existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA, use positional encodings\n",
    "that have weak extrapolation properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we introduce Position Interpolation to enable context window extensions for certain\n",
    "existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA. The key idea is, instead of extrapolation, we directly\n",
    "down-scale the position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous context\n",
    "window limit in the pre-training stage.\n",

    "## Direct extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to see the model trained on a context window of size $L = 2048$ to still work\n",
    "reasonably well on longer context window, but may not have the capability to leverage information\n",
    "that appears beyond L. For example, to answer a question located at 3000, the model trained on\n",
    "maximal window size of $L = 2048$ cannot leverage evidences provided at location 0, but still\n",
    "can leverage the evidences provided at location 2900. In contrast, in reality we see catastrophic\n",
    "behaviors, i.e., question at location 3000 cannot be answered correctly, even if the evidences are\n",
    "located at location 2900.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the reason behind? How could this happen if the attention score $a(m−n)$ decays as the relative\n",
    "distance $|m − n|$ increases, according to the RoPE paper? It turns out that the upper bound derived in the RoPE paper\n",
    "may be too loose. In fact, if we treat all trigonometric functions $e^{is\\theta_{j}}$ as basis functions, \n",
    "and think about the self-attention score as basis expansion as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(s) = \\text{Re}\\left[\\sum_{j=0}^{d/2-1}h_{j}e^{is\\theta_{j}}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the the issue becomes clear: $a(s)$ can be small in magnitude in the range of $[0, 2048]$, but gives huge values out of the\n",
    "region. The underlying reason is that the trigonometric family $e^{is\\theta_{j}}$ (with sufficiently large $d$) is\n",
    "a universal approximator and can fit any arbitrary functions. Therefore, for $a(s)$, there always exist\n",
    "coefficients ${h_j}$ (i.e. key and query) that corresponds to small function values in $[0, 2048]$ but\n",
    "much larger in regions beyond."

    "\n",
    "Instead of extrapolate the attention score to $s>L$, we replace RoPE $f$ by $f'$ defined as follows\n",

    "$$f'(\\mathbf{x}, m) = f(\\mathbf{x}, \\frac{mL}{L'})$$\n",

    "position indices from $[0,L')$ to $[0,L)$ to match the original range of indices before computing RoPE. Since we align the ranges of position indices and relative distances before\n",
    "and after extension, we mitigate the effect on attention score computation due to context window\n",
    "extensions, which can allow the model easier to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Interpolation bound**). For attention score $a(s) = \\text{Re}\\left[\\sum_{j=0}^{d/2-1}h_{j}e^{is\\theta_{j}}\\right]$, where $\\theta_{j} = c^{-2j/d}$, its interpolation value $a(s)$ for $s\\in[s_{1},s_{2}]$ is bounded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|a(s) - a_{\\text{linear}}(s)|\\le d(\\max_{j}|h_{j}|)\\frac{(s-s_{1})(s_{2}-s)}{8\\ln{c}}$$\n",

    "$$a_{\\text{linear}}(s):=(1-\\lambda(s))a(s_{1}) + \\lambda(s)a(s_{2}),\\quad \\lambda(s):=\\frac{s-s_{1}}{s_{2}-s_{1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, our method of rescaling of position indices does not introduce extra weight, or modify\n",
    "the model architecture in any way. This makes it attractive in practical applications, since most\n",
    "infrastructure and optimization for the original model can be reused after the extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning.** We can further fine-tune the interpolated model using the next token prediction task\n",
    "with interpolated position encodings on the extended context window size using a pre-training corpus\n",
    "such as the Pile. In the next section, we show that our fine-tuning process\n",
    "only needs tens to hundreds thousands of examples."
